[00:00-00:12] M: "Thanks for having this onboarding meeting. I've reviewed the roadmap, but I'd love to understand how everything fits together. What's our core focus for the hackathon demo?"

[00:12-00:31] Q: "Great question, Muhammad. ParaGraph transforms meeting discussions into visual knowledge maps. Think of it as a dynamic way to understand team conversations. For the hackathon, we're focusing on three key components: ASR integration, visualization architecture, and insights generation. Kinan, want to walk us through the ASR part?"

[00:31-00:58] K: "Sure. We're using real-time speech processing with two key innovations. First, we're implementing speaker diarization to track who's talking when. Second, we're using topic detection to color-code different discussion themes. The challenge is maintaining accuracy while processing in real-time. Ewa, this connects directly to your visualization work, especially for the temporal flow view."

[00:58-01:24] E: "Exactly, Kinan. The temporal flow view is our first layer of visualization. I'm designing it to show speaker contributions as parallel lanes, with topic-based color coding. The key is making complex information instantly graspable. Muhammad, imagine uploading a meeting recording and immediately seeing how topics flow between speakers."

[01:24-01:35] M: "That sounds powerful. How do we handle transitions between different visualization layers?"

[01:35-02:02] E: "Great point! We're using smooth morphing animations between views. When users switch from temporal flow to topic map, topics maintain their color coding but reorganize spatially to show relationships. Kinan, I'm curious - could we use the ASR confidence scores to adjust visualization opacity?"

[02:02-02:28] K: "Interesting idea, Ewa! We could map confidence scores to visual properties. Actually, I've been thinking about topic detection too. Instead of fixed categories, we could dynamically generate topic clusters based on semantic similarity. Qi, this might help with your vision for knowledge graph generation."

[02:28-02:55] Q: "Absolutely! That ties into our bigger vision. Beyond just visualizing single meetings, we want to show how ideas evolve across multiple sessions. The knowledge graph becomes this living map of team expertise. Muhammad, you'll be helping us test these different visualization layers."

[02:55-03:07] M: "Should I focus on any specific aspect during testing?"

[03:07-03:33] E: "Focus first on the temporal flow view. Watch how topic transitions appear, check if the speaker lanes are clearly distinguished. Also, we're adding interactive features - hovering over a topic highlights related segments across speakers. Think about what would help you understand meeting content quickly."

[03:33-03:59] K: "And while testing the ASR, pay attention to how well it handles technical terms. I'm implementing a domain-specific vocabulary system, but we need to balance accuracy with processing speed. Qi, should we prioritize real-time processing or accuracy for the demo?"

[03:59-04:25] Q: "For the hackathon demo, let's prioritize accuracy. We can show real-time capabilities as a stretch goal. The key is demonstrating how ParaGraph makes meeting content more accessible and actionable. Ewa's visualization needs clean data to really shine."

[04:25-04:42] E: "Agreed. Clean data will help us showcase the core value proposition. Muhammad, we can start you with some pre-recorded test meetings to establish our baseline visualization performance."

[04:42-05:00] Q: "Perfect. Let's wrap up with clear next steps. Muhammad, focus on temporal flow testing. Kinan, refine the ASR accuracy. Ewa, polish those view transitions. We'll sync again tomorrow to check progress."
