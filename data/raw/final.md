[00:00-00:20] Q: "Welcome Muhammad! We're happy to have you join us. What interested you most about ParaGraph from our previous discussion?"

[00:20-00:45] M: "Thanks everyone! I was really interested in the note-taking features. As a developer, I'm always learning new things, and it's difficult to organize everything. I tried many different apps, but they're either too strict or too messy. I want to know how ParaGraph is different."

[00:45-01:30] E: "That's a very good point, Muhammad. I take notes in eight different languages, so I understand this problem well. In our design, we focus on something important - it's not just about saving information, it's about understanding how different ideas connect to each other. That's why we made our visualization system."

[01:30-01:45] M: "Eight languages? That's amazing! Are we planning to support multiple languages?"

[01:45-02:30] Q: "Actually, languages are quite special for our team. Ewa speaks eight languages, Kinan speaks ten, and I speak three. We call ourselves 'pi-lingual' - it's a term from Doug Hofstadter, who was my PhD advisor at Indiana University. But more importantly, this gives us different perspectives on how people learn and share knowledge."

[02:30-02:45] K: "Yes, and speaking of language processing, Qi and I actually developed a Japanese ASR model that outperforms Whisper."

[02:45-03:00] M: "Really? That's impressive!"

[03:00-03:45] Q: "Thanks! But for ParaGraph, we're focusing on something even more interesting. We want to change how people share and understand information. You see, most current tools are passive - they just store information. We want to make something active, something that helps people discover connections they might miss."

[03:45-04:15] M: "What do you mean by active? Could you give an example?"

[04:15-05:00] E: "Let me show you. When we have a meeting like this, people share many ideas. Some ideas seem unrelated at first, but there are often hidden connections. Our visualization system can show these connections in a way that's easy to understand. Want to see some examples?"

[05:00-05:15] M: "Yes, please!"

[05:15-06:00] E: "So we started with a simple timeline view - it shows who spoke when and about what topics. But the interesting part is how we show connections between different parts of the discussion. We use d3.js for the interactive elements, making it easy for users to explore these connections."

[06:00-06:30] M: "That's interesting. But how do you identify these connections? Is it based on keywords?"

[06:30-07:15] Q: "It's more advanced than that. We're using a unique architecture inspired by research at CRCC - the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition. Think about how humans make analogies - we don't just match words, we understand deeper patterns. Our system tries to do something similar."

[07:15-07:45] K: "Right, and this affects how we handle the technical implementation. For the speech processing part, we need to preserve not just the words, but also the context and flow of ideas. This helps our system find meaningful connections later."

[07:45-08:15] M: "So it's like having an AI that thinks more like a human? That's fascinating. What about practical applications?"

[08:15-09:00] Q: "Exactly. Take universities for example. We're already in talks with several institutions like MIT and Johns Hopkins. They're interested because this could transform how knowledge is shared and preserved in academic settings."

[09:00-09:30] E: "And it's not just academia. Think about companies where teams collaborate across different departments. Each group has their own way of thinking and talking about problems. ParaGraph can help bridge these gaps."

[09:30-10:00] M: "That makes sense. Do we have any early feedback from users?"

[10:00-10:45] K: "We've been testing with some research groups. One interesting finding is that users often discover connections they hadn't noticed during the actual meetings. It's like having a second brain that helps you see patterns."

[10:45-11:15] M: "What about privacy? Since we're processing sensitive meeting data..."

[11:15-12:00] Q: "Great question! Privacy is a top priority. We've designed our system so that organizations can run it on their own infrastructure. Also, we're implementing strong encryption and access controls."

[12:00-12:30] M: "And what about real-time processing? Can users see these connections forming during the meeting?"

[12:30-13:15] E: "That's actually something we're working on now. The challenge is balancing immediate insights with deeper analysis. Sometimes connections only become clear after seeing the full context."

[13:15-13:45] K: "We're also thinking about how to handle different types of meetings. Technical discussions might need different visualization approaches compared to strategic planning sessions."

[13:45-14:30] Q: "Yes, and this connects back to our vision of active learning. ParaGraph isn't just about recording meetings - it's about helping teams build knowledge together. Each meeting becomes a building block in the team's collective understanding."

[14:30-15:00] M: "I see how this goes beyond simple note-taking. What's our immediate focus for development?"

[15:00-15:45] E: "We're currently refining the visualization components. I'm working on making the interface more intuitive, especially for exploring complex connection networks."

[15:45-16:30] K: "On the technical side, we're optimizing the processing pipeline. The goal is to handle longer meetings efficiently while maintaining accuracy in connection detection."

[16:30-17:15] Q: "And I'm coordinating with potential partners. We're getting valuable feedback that helps us prioritize features. For example, academic users want better integration with research repositories."

[17:15-17:45] M: "How can I help? Where should I start?"

[17:45-18:30] Q: "Given your background in development, you could work with Kinan on the processing pipeline. But first, spend some time exploring our visualization system. Understanding the user experience will help you make better technical decisions."

[18:30-19:00] E: "Yes, and feel free to share your thoughts on the interface. Fresh perspectives often lead to improvements we hadn't considered."

[19:00-19:30] K: "I can walk you through our current architecture tomorrow. There are some interesting challenges you might enjoy working on."

[19:30-20:15] Q: "Perfect. Remember, ParaGraph started with a simple idea - making knowledge sharing more active and meaningful. Everything we build supports this vision. Welcome to the team, Muhammad!"

[20:15-20:30] M: "Thanks everyone! I'm excited to start contributing."
