Our system doesn't just record these ideas - it actively looks for patterns and connections. For example, we use d3.js to create interactive visualizations that let users explore how different topics relate to each other. What's unique is how we handle the temporal aspect - you can see how ideas evolve and connect over time. The visualization isn't static; it adapts as new connections emerge during the discussion.",
